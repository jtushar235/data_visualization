**Tree Data Analysis Project**:

This repository contains an analysis of tree species and their impact on carbon sequestration, as well as costs associated with planting them. The data and analysis can help inform environmental and renewable energy projects such as the planting of solar plants.

**Project Overview**:

The goal of this project is to analyze tree counts, carbon sequestration rates, and costs to assist in planning environmental and renewable energy initiatives.

**Files in the Repository**
**tree__data.ipynb:**

A Jupyter notebook containing the analysis of tree data. This notebook includes steps to load, process, and visualize the data from the Excel file, as well as the calculation of carbon sequestration and cost analysis for various tree species.

**tree_counts.xlsx:**

An Excel file containing the raw data for different tree species. This includes:
Tree species names
Total tree count
Carbon sequestration rate (per tree)
Planting costs (in USD)
Total cost of planting and maintenance

**tree_data_analysis.pbix:**

A Power BI file containing an interactive dashboard for visualizing the tree data analysis. This dashboard can be used to explore tree counts, carbon sequestration, and associated costs.
